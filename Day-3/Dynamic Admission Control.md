Absolutely! Validating and Mutating Admission Controllers are important Kubernetes (K8s) concepts, especially for the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** exam. As of **2025**, here's an updated and clear explanation to help with your prep:

---

## üîê What Are Admission Controllers?

Admission Controllers are plugins that **intercept API requests** to the Kubernetes API server **after authentication/authorization but before the object is persisted in etcd**.

There are two main types:

1. **Mutating Admission Controllers** ‚Äì modify the incoming request.
2. **Validating Admission Controllers** ‚Äì validate the request, rejecting it if needed.

Both can work **in sequence**:

* Mutating runs first (can modify).
* Validating runs after (can only accept or reject).

## üöß Mutating Admission Webhooks

* Purpose: Automatically modify (mutate) requests before they‚Äôre stored.
* Example use:

  * Injecting sidecar containers (like Istio or Linkerd).
  * Setting default values for custom fields.

### YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: example-mutating-webhook
webhooks:
  - name: add-label.k8s.io
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations: ["CREATE"]
        resources: ["pods"]
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: my-webhook-service
        namespace: my-namespace
        path: /mutate
      caBundle: <CA_BUNDLE>
    admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
    sideEffects: None
```

## ‚úÖ Validating Admission Webhooks

* Purpose: Check that resources **meet policies** before allowing them.
* Example use:

  * Enforcing security policies.
  * Blocking privileged containers or disallowed image registries.

### YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: example-validating-webhook
webhooks:
  - name: validate-pod-labels.k8s.io
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations: ["CREATE"]
        resources: ["pods"]
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: validation-service
        namespace: my-namespace
        path: /validate
      caBundle: <CA_BUNDLE>
    admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
    sideEffects: None
```

## üß† Key Concepts to Remember

| Concept            | Details                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Order**          | Mutating webhooks run before Validating ones                            |
| **Scope**          | Can target specific resources, verbs (e.g., CREATE, UPDATE), namespaces |
| **Communication**  | Webhooks use HTTPS; must have a valid CA bundle                         |
| **FailurePolicy**  | `Ignore` or `Fail` ‚Äì defines what happens if webhook is unreachable     |
| **TimeoutSeconds** | Defines how long the API server waits before timeout (1‚Äì30 seconds)     |
| **SideEffects**    | Must be declared (`None` or `NoneOnDryRun`)                             |

## üî• 2025 CKA Exam Tips

* Focus more on:

  * Creating, debugging, and testing webhook configurations.
  * Using tools like `kubectl create`, `curl`, and `openssl` to test webhook communication.
  * Knowing the flow: **API call ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí Admission Controllers ‚Üí etcd**
* Learn how to:

  * Deploy a webhook server (often via a service and Deployment in the cluster).
  * Handle certs properly (especially CA bundles and TLS setup).
  * Debug webhook failures (`kubectl describe`, logs, etc.).
